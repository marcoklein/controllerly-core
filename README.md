# controllerly-core
Controllerly Core for Robust Connection Management with WebRTC.

This is the core for Controllerly. It wraps around the PeerJs Data Connection and enhances the existing connection methods. All messages are tracked and performance is measured. Additionally, keep alive messages prevent the connection from "falling asleep".
